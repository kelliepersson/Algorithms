 * (1) starts with a list of numbers from 2 to n in order. 
 * 
 * (2) on each step the first element is identified as the next prime (placed in prime array) and removed from the working sequence. 
 *     The results of multiplying this prime with each element of the remaining list elements are marked in the list for subsequent deletion and
 *     removed from the working sequence.  After which the process is repeated.
 *
 * (3)  when the next identified prime exceeds the square root of the upper limit (prime * prime > limit), all the remaining numbers in the list are prime.

 * The computation of the values for phi(k) has to consider three different cases:
 *
 * (1) k is prime: phi(k) = k - 1, which is trivial
 *
 * (2) k = m * p with m and p coprime and p prime: phi(k) = phi(m * p) = phi(m) * phi(p) = phi(m) * (p - 1)
 *
 * (3) k = m * p with m = m' * p^n and m' and p coprime and p prime: phi(k) = phi(m) * p
